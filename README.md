```

## Memory Architecture

Cortex Memory organizes data using a **virtual filesystem** approach with the `cortex://` URI scheme:

```
cortex://{dimension}/{scope}/{category}/{id}
```

- **Dimension**: `user`, `agent`, or `session`
- **Scope**: Tenant or identifier
- **Category**: `memories`, `profiles`, `entities`, `sessions`, etc.
- **ID**: Unique memory identifier

## Three-Tier Memory Layers

Cortex Memory implements a **progressive disclosure** system with three abstraction layers:

| Layer | Purpose | Token Usage | Use Case |
|-------|---------|-------------|----------|
| **L0 (Abstract)** | Quick relevance filtering | ~50 tokens | Initial screening |
| **L1 (Overview)** | Structured summary | ~200-300 tokens | Context building |
| **L2 (Detail)** | Full content | Variable | Deep inspection |

This tiered approach optimizes LLM context window usage by loading only the necessary detail level.

# 🖥 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [**Rust**](https://www.rust-lang.org) (version 1.86 or later)
- [**Qdrant**](https://qdrant.tech/) vector database
- An **OpenAI-compatible** LLM API endpoint (for memory extraction and analysis)
- An **OpenAI-compatible** Embedding API endpoint (for vector search)

### Installation
The simplest way to get started is to use the CLI and Service binaries, which can be installed via `cargo`.
```sh
# Install the CLI for command-line management
cargo install --path cortex-mem-cli

# Install the REST API Service for application integration
cargo install --path cortex-mem-service

# Install the MCP server for AI assistant integrations
cargo install --path cortex-mem-mcp
```

### Configuration
Cortex Memory applications (`cortex-mem-cli`, `cortex-mem-service`, `cortex-mem-mcp`) are configured via a `config.toml` file. The CLI will look for this file in the current directory by default, or you can pass a path using the `-c` or `--config` flag.

Here is a sample `config.toml` with explanations:

```toml
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Qdrant Vector Database Configuration
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[qdrant]
url = "http://localhost:6333"     # URL of your Qdrant instance
collection_name = "cortex-memory" # Name of the collection to use for memories
timeout_secs = 5                  # Timeout for Qdrant operations
embedding_dim = 1536              # Embedding dimension (e.g., 1536 for text-embedding-3-small)

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# LLM (Large Language Model) Configuration (for reasoning, extraction)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[llm]
api_base_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1" # Base URL of your LLM provider
api_key = "sk-your-openai-api-key"         # API key for the LLM provider (sensitive)
model_efficient = "gpt-4o-mini"            # Model for extraction and classification
temperature = 0.7                          # Sampling temperature for LLM responses
max_tokens = 8192                          # Max tokens for LLM generation

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Embedding Service Configuration
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[embedding]
api_base_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1" # Base URL of your embedding provider
api_key = "sk-your-openai-api-key"         # API key for the embedding provider (sensitive)
model_name = "text-embedding-3-small"      # Name of the embedding model to use
batch_size = 16                            # Number of texts to embed in a single batch
timeout_secs = 10                          # Timeout for embedding requests

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Cortex Data Directory Configuration
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[cortex]
data_dir = "./cortex-data"  # Directory for storing memory files and sessions
```

# 🚀 Usage

### CLI (`cortex-mem-cli`)

The CLI provides a powerful interface for direct interaction with the memory system. All commands require a `config.toml` file, which can be specified with `--config <path>`. The `--tenant` flag allows multi-tenant isolation.

#### Add a Memory
Adds a new message to a session thread, automatically storing it in the memory system.

```sh
cortex-mem-cli --config config.toml --tenant acme add --thread thread-123 --role user --content "The user is interested in Rust programming."
```
- `--thread <id>`: (Required) The thread/session ID.
- `--role <role>`: Message role (user/assistant/system). Default: "user"
- `content`: The text content of the message.

#### Search for Memories
Performs a semantic vector search across the memory store.

```sh
cortex-mem-cli --config config.toml --tenant acme search "what are the user's hobbies?" --thread thread-123 --limit 10
```
- `query`: The natural language query for the search.
- `--thread <id>`: Filter memories by thread ID.
- `--limit <n>`: Maximum number of results. Default: 10
- `--min-score <score>`: Minimum relevance score (0.0-1.0). Default: 0.3
- `--scope <scope>`: Search scope: "session", "user", or "agent". Default: "session"

#### List Memories
Retrieves a list of memories from a specific URI path.

```sh
cortex-mem-cli --config config.toml --tenant acme list --uri "cortex://session" --include-abstracts
```
- `--uri <path>`: URI path to list (e.g., "cortex://session" or "cortex://user/preferences").
- `--include-abstracts`: Include L0 abstracts in results.

#### Get a Specific Memory
Retrieves a specific memory by its URI.

```sh
cortex-mem-cli --config config.toml --tenant acme get "cortex://session/thread-123/memory-456.md"
```
- `uri`: The memory URI.
- `--abstract-only`: Show L0 abstract instead of full content.

#### Delete a Memory
Removes a memory from the store by its URI.

```sh
cortex-mem-cli --config config.toml --tenant acme delete "cortex://session/thread-123/memory-456.md"
```

#### Session Management
Manage conversation sessions.

```sh
# List all sessions
cortex-mem-cli --config config.toml --tenant acme session list

# Create a new session
cortex-mem-cli --config config.toml --tenant acme session create thread-456 --title "My Session"
```
